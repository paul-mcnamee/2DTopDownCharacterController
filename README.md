# 2DTopDownCharacterController
A basic character controller class for a CharacterBody2D used as a starting point for a 2d top down style game.

This was adapted from dragon1freak's [PlatformCharacterController](https://github.com/dragon1freak/PlatformerCharacterController) though a lot of the behavior has changed to accommodate the top down style.
